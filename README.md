# Newsfeed App

This is a simple newsfeed app that I put together for Studio 71, it takes a stream of JSON newsfeed items and creates interesting data interactions.

## Implemented Functionality:
- Search newsfeed by message
- Filter newsfeed by feed item type
- Favorite posts
- Like posts
- Caches and retrieve liked and favorited posts
- Filter by liked or favorited posts


# Setup:
to install: 
> npm install

to run: 
> npm start

Now open browser and go to 'localhost:3000' and voila!
